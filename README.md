# POLICY EVALUATION

## AIM
To develop a Python program to evaluate the given policy by maximizing its cumulative reward while dealing with slippery terrain.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
We are assigned with the task of creating an RL agent to solve the "Bandit Slippery Walk" problem.
The environment consists of Seven states representing discrete positions the agent can occupy.
The agent must learn to navigate this environment while dealing with the challenge of slippery terrain.
Slippery terrain introduces stochasticity in the agent's actions, making it difficult to predict the outcomes of its actions accurately..

## POLICY EVALUATION FUNCTION
Include the policy evaluation function

## OUTPUT:
Mention the first and second policies along with its state value function and compare them

## RESULT:
